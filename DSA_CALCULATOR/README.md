🧠 About the Project

This project serves as a hands-on Data Structures visualizer where users can insert, delete, and view how elements behave in different data structures.
It’s an ideal project for beginners in DSA and Python who want to see concepts come alive visually.

⚙️ Features

✅ Stack (LIFO) → Push / Pop visualization
✅ Queue (FIFO) → Enqueue / Dequeue animation
✅ Linked List → Insert / Delete / Clear operations
✅ Binary Tree → Visual insertion structure
✅ Real-time plotting using Matplotlib & NetworkX
✅ Simple, colorful UI using Streamlit
